            <p> My favorite hobby is playing, since I'm still a child and I haven't yet become a teenager, I can play and I love to play! So, playing is one of my top priorities and me and my little sister, who is 2 years younger than me, mostly play with dad, but we still do play with our other family members, like grandpa, grandma, our fia(our dad's younger sister) momma and eachother! I love to play: hide and seek, animal race(racing, but in the form of a random animal which the refferee says, and I grew up playing this!), playing games with bangles(I have no idea how dad found games that require bangles but be stumbled upon a youtube channel called 'Fundoor' and it gives many ideas for indoor games because of lockdown) and many more!
